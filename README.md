# foljapp

A working Albanian verb reference built around a reusable TypeScript morphology
engine and a Rust corpus-evidence pipeline.

## Actual search-to-reference proof

[![Searching for pun and opening the complete punoj reference](docs/motion/search-to-reference.gif)](https://foljapp.pages.dev/)

This six-second capture comes from the public deployment. It shows the real
search suggestions for `pun`, stable navigation to `/verb/punoj`, and the
conjugation reference loading—not a staged mockup. The exact frame, browser,
encoding, and privacy boundary is recorded in
[`docs/motion/README.md`](docs/motion/README.md).

## Status

Pre-alpha. The web app, conjugation engine, verb corpus, reference pages,
playground, and local corpus tooling are active. The current public build is at
[foljapp.pages.dev](https://foljapp.pages.dev/).

## Product surface

- [Search and browse](https://foljapp.pages.dev/browse) the checked-in verb corpus.
- Open a [citation-aware verb page](https://foljapp.pages.dev/verb/punoj) with
  principal parts, full paradigms, IPA, English glosses, and decomposition traces.
- Explore forms in the [playground](https://foljapp.pages.dev/playground), run
  [practice sessions](https://foljapp.pages.dev/practice), and read the
  [grammar articles](https://foljapp.pages.dev/articles) and
  [source register](https://foljapp.pages.dev/references).
- Consume the same engine through the read-only
  [verb index](https://foljapp.pages.dev/api/verbs),
  [verb-detail JSON](https://foljapp.pages.dev/api/verbs/punoj),
  [IGT](https://foljapp.pages.dev/api/verbs/punoj?format=igt),
  [CoNLL-U](https://foljapp.pages.dev/api/verbs/punoj?format=conllu), and
  [OpenAPI document](https://foljapp.pages.dev/api/openapi.json).

## Layout

```
apps/web/              Next.js 15 app: UI, routes, and API handlers
packages/engine/       TypeScript Albanian morphology/conjugation engine
packages/data/         Checked-in verb data schemas and loaders
data/verbs/            Checked-in verb corpus
data/opus/             Small checked-in parallel-sentence fallback index
data/corpora/          Download ledger only; raw corpora stay in .cache/
scripts/               Narrow build/download utilities
tools/corpus-indexer/  Rust scanner for local corpus indexing
openspec/              Specs, changes, and roadmap
```

Local generated artifacts, downloaded corpora, SQLite indexes, and build caches
belong under `.cache/` and are intentionally not deployed.

## App vs Corpus Lab

`apps/`, `packages/`, `data/verbs/`, and `data/opus/examples.json` are the
website/runtime surface. They should stay small enough to build and deploy.

`data/corpora/`, `scripts/*corpus*`, and `tools/corpus-indexer/` are the local
corpus lab. They download, scan, audit, and explain large corpora from `.cache/`;
their outputs are evidence for development and future backend services, not
Cloudflare Pages assets.

## Evidence flow

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  V["Checked-in verb JSON"] --> D["Data schemas and validation"]
  D --> E["TypeScript morphology engine"]
  E --> W["Next.js reference pages and read-only API"]
  E --> T["Generated search targets"]

  subgraph L["Local corpus lab — not deployed"]
    C["Raw corpora in .cache"] --> R["Rust corpus indexer"]
    T --> R
    R --> S["Retained examples, indexes, and audit reports"]
  end

  S -. "local evidence" .-> W
```

The deployment boundary is deliberate: the public app ships the reviewed verb
data and deterministic engine, while raw corpora, local SQLite/Tantivy indexes,
and large generated reports remain outside the Cloudflare Pages artifact.

## Roadmap

The full roadmap and per-capability specs live in [`openspec/`](./openspec/).
See [`openspec/config.yaml`](./openspec/config.yaml) for the project context
and 14-capability roadmap across 5 phases.

Active changes:

```
openspec list
```

## Local development

```sh
nvm use         # activates Node version pinned in .nvmrc
npm ci
npm run dev     # boots the webapp at http://localhost:3000
```

## Local corpus indexing

The website can read local sentence examples from
`.cache/corpus-local-full.sqlite`. That file is generated locally from raw
corpora and is not committed.

```sh
npm run build:corpus-targets      # generated foljapp forms to search for
npm run scan:local-corpus         # Rust generated-form classifier over downloaded corpora
npm run build:local-corpus-index  # both steps above
npm run build:corpus-candidate-cache # optional parsed-candidate cache for reruns
npm run scan:local-corpus:cached  # classifier using the complete candidate cache
npm run build:corpus-search-index # Tantivy phrase-search index from retained examples
npm run search:corpus -- --query="të punoj"
```

See [`data/corpora/README.md`](./data/corpora/README.md) for downloaded corpus
inventory and source notes, and
[`tools/corpus-indexer/README.md`](./tools/corpus-indexer/README.md) for the
Rust scanner commands.

## Quality gates

```sh
npm run typecheck   # TypeScript strict mode across all workspaces
npm run lint        # ESLint (Next.js + import-sort)
npm test            # Vitest across all workspaces
npm run verify:proof # README motion asset, link, and provenance contract
npm run build       # Next.js production build
npm run test:e2e    # Playwright E2E (requires browsers installed)
npm run audit:deps # npm audit at the high level, with one documented exception
```

GitHub Actions protects the morphology engine with TypeScript regression checks,
verifies the shipped product flows in Chromium, builds the production app, audits
dependencies, and enforces Rust formatting, Clippy, and corpus-index integrity—with
read-only permissions and immutable action revisions.

## Security and maintenance

Report vulnerabilities through GitHub's private reporting form and review the
[security policy](./SECURITY.md) for the deployed-app and local-corpus boundary.
Dependabot monitors the npm workspace, Rust corpus indexer, and GitHub Actions;
security fixes are grouped separately from routine minor and patch maintenance.
